# UTS-2 My Songs for You

Be Your Glow
Lirik by Muhammad Afif Habiburrahman
Music: SUNO

[Verse]
Mirror whispers lies I don't need to hear
Every crack shows a story
Every scar's sincere
Tried to be someone else
But they never fit
Now I'm stepping out
Yeah
I'm done with it

[Prechorus]
The world can spin
It can scream
It can shout
But I’m the only one I can't live without

[Chorus]
Be your glow
Let it shine
Let it show
You’re the fire
You’re the spark
You’re the soul
No one else
No disguise
Just your own
Be your glow
Be your glow

[Verse 2]
Chasing shadows only leaves you lost
Every mask has a price
What’s the cost
Painted smiles can fade
But truth will stay
I’m the art I was born to display

[Prechorus]
They’ll point
They’ll judge
Let them misunderstand
But the power’s mine when I take my stand

[Chorus]
Be your glow
Let it shine
Let it show
You’re the fire
You’re the spark
You’re the soul
No one else
No disguise
Just your own
Be your glow
Be your glow
