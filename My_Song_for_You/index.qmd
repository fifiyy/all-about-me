### **Be Your Glow**
**Lyrics by:** Muhammad Afif Habiburrahman  
**Music by:** SUNO

**[Verse 1]** Mirror whispers lies I don't need to hear  
Every crack shows a story  
Every scar's sincere  
Tried to be someone else  
But they never fit  
Now I'm stepping out  
Yeah, I'm done with it  

**[Pre-chorus]** The world can spin, it can scream, it can shout  
But **I’m the only one I can't live without** **[Chorus]** **Be your glow** Let it shine, let it show  
You’re the fire, you’re the spark, you’re the soul  
No one else, no disguise, just your own  
Be your glow, be your glow  

**[Verse 2]** Chasing shadows only leaves you lost  
Every mask has a price, what’s the cost?  
Painted smiles can fade, but truth will stay  
**I’m the art I was born to display** **[Pre-chorus]** They’ll point, they’ll judge, let them misunderstand  
But the power’s mine when I take my stand  

**[Chorus]** **Be your glow** Let it shine, let it show  
You’re the fire, you’re the spark, you’re the soul  
No one else, no disguise, just your own  
Be your glow, be your glow
